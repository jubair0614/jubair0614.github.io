Software Security is offered to 5th semester students of Software Engineering program. In this course, I covered fundamental concepts of security focusing on in-built security while developing a software. Aspects of software security like vulnerability assessment, attack surface, risk factors, misuse and/or abuse cases, OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities, exploiting vulnerability by masquerading white hat hacker etc.
