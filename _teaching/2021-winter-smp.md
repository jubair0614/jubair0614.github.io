Software Metrics and Process is offered to 7th semester students of Software Engineering program. In this course, I taught the basics of software metrics like measurement theory, computation of various metrics for internal and external attributes of software. Conducting empirical study, survey and applying pertinent metrics to a specific problem are also taught in the course.
